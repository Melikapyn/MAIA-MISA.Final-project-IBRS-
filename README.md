# MAIA-MISA.Final-project-IBRS-


In this project, we focus on the segmentation of the three primary brain tissues - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) - using the brain MRI data from the IBSR 18 dataset. Our approach integrates two key methodologies: traditional techniques involving multi- atlas and probabilistic atlas models, and advanced methods utilizing deep learning, specifically the U-net model. The objective was to identify the most effective segmentation strategy for our specific problem. Through attentive experimentation, we achieved Dice scores of 0.81, 0.89, and 0.80 for CSF, GM, and WM respectively using a single probabilistic atlas. Notably, the U-net model yielded even higher scores of 0.89, 0.94, and 0.93 for each tissue type in sequence.
